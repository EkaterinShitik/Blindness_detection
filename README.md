# Blindness_detection
Different models were trained to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy based on oculus fundus images.

The data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data) in terms of APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection competition.

Some of the models can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TFusD9x4mBU0HftTc6vu2qAixpNP9B3v?usp=sharing)

The best metrics were obtained for pretrained ResNet-152 model:
- *accuracy* 0.655
- *f1 score* 0.651

The model can be used with our [Telegram bot](https://github.com/glitchheadgit/tgbot_ird_prediction).
